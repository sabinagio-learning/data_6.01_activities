# 6.01 Activity 1

Answer the following questions:

- How is tableau extracted data different than a tableau live connection?

Extracted data is static, whereas a live connection is dynamic. However, working with extracted data is faster than working with a live connection.

- What is the difference between these two Tableau workbook file extensions `.twb` and `.twbx`?

The .twb extension doesn't contain the data source file, but only the link to the source - so if it needs to be shared, the data source needs to be added alongside. The .twbx extension contains a copy of the data source alongside and can be shared directly, but it has the drawback of not updating automatically after the data source has been changed.

- What is the difference between filters and parameters?

Filters are used to select specific data within a chart, whereas a parameter works as a label for data within a chart.
